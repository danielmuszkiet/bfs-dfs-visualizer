# BFS and DFS Visualizer

This project is a visualization tool for two fundamental graph traversal algorithms:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS).

These algorithms are widely used in computer science and are fundamental in understanding graph theory and solving various real-world problems.

## Features

- Interactive Visualization: Users can generate random maze and visualize how BFS and DFS traverse the maze, from startpoint to endpoint.
  Customizable Settings: Users can adjust parameters such as graph size.
- Educational Tool: This tool is designed not only for experienced programmers but also for beginners learning about graph algorithms. The visual representation enhances understanding by providing a clear illustration of how these algorithms explore graphs.

## Usage

1. clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Type o press Enter
